# SmartScrap: E-Waste Management System

A full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of e-waste collection and management. This project features a secure REST API built with **Spring Boot** and a dynamic, responsive frontend built with **React**. The system provides role-based access for users and administrators to manage the entire lifecycle of an e-waste pickup request.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Secure JWT Authentication:** End-to-end secure registration and login flow using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Distinct dashboards and permissions for `ROLE_USER` and `ROLE_ADMIN` roles, ensuring a secure separation of concerns.
- **Dynamic User Dashboard:** A feature-rich interface where users can:
  - Submit detailed e-waste pickup requests with fields for device type, brand, model, condition, and quantity.
  - **Upload multiple images** for each request.
  - Track the live status of their submissions (`Pending`, `Approved`, `Scheduled`, `Rejected`).
  - View important feedback, such as a **scheduled pickup time** or a **reason for rejection**.
  - View and update their own profile information.
- **Comprehensive Admin Dashboard:** A protected panel where administrators can:
  - View system-wide statistics at a glance.
  - Manage all user requests via an interactive modal to update statuses, set pickup times, or provide rejection reasons.
  - View a complete list of all registered users in the system.
- **Responsive UI:** A clean and modern user interface built with **CSS Modules** for component-scoped styling, ensuring a great experience on any device.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your machine:
- JDK 17 or newer (Java Development Kit)
- Apache Maven
- Node.js and npm (or yarn)
- MySQL Server

### 1. Backend Setup

First, let's get the Spring Boot server running.

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Create the Database:**
    Open your MySQL client and run the following command to create the database:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE smartscrap_db;
    ```
3.  **Configure Application Properties:**
    Navigate to the backend properties file:
    ```
    smartscrap-backend/src/main/resources/application.properties
    ```
    - Update the `spring.datasource.password` with your MySQL root password.
    - Configure the default admin account that will be created on the first run.
    ```properties
    # Database
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/smartscrap_db
    spring.datasource.username=root
    spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

    # Default Admin Account
    smartscrap.app.admin.fullName=Admin User
    smartscrap.app.admin.email=admin@smartscrap.com
    smartscrap.app.admin.password=adminpassword123
    ```
4.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    Navigate to the backend's root folder and run the application using Maven:
    ```bash
    cd smartscrap-backend
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 2. Frontend Setup

Now, let's get the React user interface running.

1.  **Navigate to the frontend folder:**
    Open a **new terminal** and navigate to the frontend directory.
    ```bash
    cd smartscrap-frontend
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the Frontend App:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The React development server will start, and the application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìñ Application Usage

1.  **Register a User:** Navigate to the registration page (`/register`) and create a new user account with all the required details.
2.  **Log In as a User:** Use the credentials of the new user to log in. You will be redirected to the user dashboard where you can submit and track requests.
3.  **Log In as an Admin:**
    - The admin account is automatically created on the first backend startup using the credentials you set in `application.properties`.
    - Log out from the user account.
    - Log in using the admin email and password (e.g., `admin@smartscrap.com` / `adminpassword123`).
    - You will be redirected to the admin dashboard with full control over users and requests.
